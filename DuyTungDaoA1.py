# Brief program details: This program is a simple shopping list that could
# also be used for TODO lists or similar purposes.
# The program maintains a list of items in a file, and each item has:
# â€¢	name, price, priority (1, 2 or 3), whether it is required or completed
# Users can choose to see the list of required items or completed items, including a total of the (estimated) price of
# all of those items. The lists will be sorted by priority.
# Users can add new items and mark items as completed.
# They cannot change items from completed to required.
